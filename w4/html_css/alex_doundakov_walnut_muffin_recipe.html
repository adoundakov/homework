      <h2>Description</h2>
      <a name="Description"></a>
      <p>
        Muffins are a sweet or savory treat that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muffin">originate</a> from the US.
        This recipe from <a href="http://www.onceuponachef.com/2011/02/banana-honey-walnut-muffins.html">Once Upon a Chef</a> is one of the best I have ever tried.
        Each serving yields about 12 muffins.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <a name="Ingredients"></a>

      <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1/3 cup plus 1 tbsp honey (in 2 portions)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1-1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mashed banana, preferably from an overripe banana</li>
        <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/3 cup whole milk</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Directions</h2>
      <a name="Directions"></a>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Preheat oven to 350&deg;F. Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray, then line with paper liners.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a small bowl, toss nuts with 1 tbsp of the honey and cinnamon until evenly coated.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, beat butter with sugar and remaining 1/3 cup of honey until fluffy (2-3 minutes).
          Scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary. Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat until fully incorporated between additions.
          Beat in banana and vanilla. At low speed, add dry ingredients in 2 batches, alternating with the milk.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spoon batter into prepared muffin tin and sprinkle with the nut topping. Bake muffins until tops are golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
          This should take about 30 minutes, then let the muffins cool for about 10 minutes in the pan.
          Turn out the muffins onto a rack and let them cool for at least 15 minutes before serving.
